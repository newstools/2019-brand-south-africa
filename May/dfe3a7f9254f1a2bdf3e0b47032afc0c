Johannesburg, Thursday 30 May 2019 –  Brand South Africa calls on all citizens to play their part and rally behind the country’s sports teams and to kick off, the cricket team – the Proteas who are at the ICC Cricket World Cup in England. Just as the former great statesman Nelson Mandela once said; “Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair”. In support of the national cricket team, in enhancing awareness of Nation Brand image and instilling nation pride, Brand South Africa has collaborated with Bidvest Wanderers Stadium to have a public viewing area – a fan park in place for all. Sports is one of the greatest unifiers for the country and it for this that the fan park becomes a platform to nurture this strength. “Following the successful launch of Brand South Africa’s Sports Friday, it is important we continue to drive citizenship support in the various sporting fraternities. Support has many positive benefits the most important being the ability to succeed despite the odds and that’s the reason behind Sports Friday and the fan park”, said Brand South Africa’s Acting Chief Marketing, Ms Sithembile Ntombela.
