One of Brand South Africa’s domestic campaigns is the promotion of constitutional awareness, especially targeted at the youth. As such last week Brand South Africa visited Katleho Mpumelelo High School, in the far South of Johannesburg to share information on constitutional awareness. Accompanied by Play Your Part Ambassador, Sihle Ndaba, a multitalented, activist and actress,  who gave great emphasis on the importance of young people knowing their rights and understanding what the country’s constitution has to offer.             “The Constitution is the supreme law of our country – that is why it is essential that we all familiarise ourselves with its contents. It’s our goal that young people know and exercise these rights”, said Sihle in her welcome address to the learners.            The activation was an opportunity to engage learners on what the 16 days of activism campaign is all about and how learners need to  speak up against any form of abuse or violence whether  at home or at school so that they can get help. This is their constitutional right. “These kinds of activations are very important especially towards the festive season to motivate young people to understand their rights and taking care of each other. We are all aware of the social ills that young people face and this was to say to them they are not alone, they have the constitution on their side but everyone has to play their part and be willing to help,”, said Brand South Africa’s Stakeholder Relations Manager Ms Toni Gumede.
